# TECHNO STUDY Agile Software Testing Project - 3
## shopdemo.e-junkie.com TR Sprint

### One-Week Sprint
**URL:** [shopdemo.e-junkie.com Project](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

### Overview of the Project

The scope of this project is to create and manage an automation test project including the user stories provided in the attachment. The project encompasses Team Collaboration, Code Management, and Testing processes.

#### Step 1: Creating Stories and Task Assignments

- Understand the given stories and create a task for each story.
- Open the tasks in Jira and discuss them in sprint meetings.
- Prioritize the tasks in sprint meetings by estimating them (Refinement / Sprint Planning).
- Distribute tasks based on the number of team members to create a sprint backlog.

#### Step 2: Writing Test Scenarios

- Write test scenarios using Jira Xray or Zephyr plugin.
- Each scenario should include the scenario name, description, steps, and expected results.
- Refine test scenarios during daily standup/daily scrum meetings.

#### Step 3: Code Development and Execution of Tests

- Create a GitHub repository to write test code.
- The Team Leader will create the master branch and set protection settings.
- Team members clone the master branch locally and create a new branch in their own name.
- Develop test code in their own branches to minimize conflicts.
- Our web environment [www.shopdemo.e-junkie.com]() will already be developed and functional.

#### Step 4: Code Review and Merging Processes

- Each member initiates a pull request towards master for the code they wrote in their own branch.
- Team sends pull requests to the Team Leader for approval and asks them to merge them into the main branch.
- The Team Leader reviews pull requests (peer review / code review) and requests corrections if necessary.
- Approved pull requests are merged into the main branch by the Team Leader.

#### Step 5: Post-Sprint Evaluation and Transfers

- Conduct a retrospective after the sprint to evaluate what went well and what could be improved.
- Optionally, complex or unlearned stories can be transferred to the next sprint.
- Share the GitHub repository address and Jira board screenshot on communication channels like Discord.
- When sharing, tag our Teachers and Mentors.

### Support and Mentorship

Team members can seek help from the Team Leader or group communication channels when facing issues. If necessary, create "Knowledge Transfer" (KT) requests via Discord or other methods and tag your team members and us. As mentors, we are always here to share our knowledge and experiences.
